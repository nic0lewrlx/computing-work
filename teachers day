Ms Poh's lessons are never boring
especially when she starts drawing maps.
The proportions are never accurate
causing the whole class to laugh.

Ariel always tries to be a good history rap
always trying to answer her questions
but to no avail as Regina or Josh would answer it instead
She is a kind and funny teacher
so I would like to wish her:
A VERY HAPPY TEACHERS DAY!
