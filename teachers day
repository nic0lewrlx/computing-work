Ms Poh's lessons are never boring
especially when she starts drawing maps.
The proportions are never accurate
leading to resounding laughter.

Ariel always tries to be a good history rep
trying her best to answer her questions
but to no avail as despite her efforts,
Regina or Josh would answer it!
She is kind and funny
so I would like to wish her:
A HAPPY TEACHERS DAY!
